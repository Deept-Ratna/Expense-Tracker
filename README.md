# Expense-Tracker
I made an Expense tracker using HTML,CSS and JAVASCRIPT.
How to Use:
Add the item bought and its amount and press Add Transaction and it will update your current amount and you can see your expenditure history under the History column.
You can delete any wrong enteries by hovering over the item in History and pressing the delete button.
